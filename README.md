# Password Manager
First ever proper application I created in python, or ever for that matter. I tried to make the code readable but I'll admit, I had my lazy moments.
Anyways, this was a 3-day project, but I'll work on it a bit more if need be.
### Features Include:
- Setup
- Pin to unlock passwords
- Passwords are stored as encrypted text
- Uses sql database for config and passwords
- New Password generator
- Auto Backups (On exit)
- Light & Dark theme
- Create, Edit, and Delete built in
- Internal or External Storage
